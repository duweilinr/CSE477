    <h1>Monty Python Science</h1>

<p>Science in the middle ages was considerably different from
   that of today. While modern sparrows have little ability
   to transport heavy loads, the sparrows of that era routinely
   flew coconuts from the tropics to Britain. Rabbits, a
   relatively tame and manageable animal today, were vicious
   killers, able to rip limbs from bodies and tear out throats.</p>


<p>
    This site collects up some of the important information
    about that period of our history and analyzes how the
    physical laws of that time differ from our own.</p>
